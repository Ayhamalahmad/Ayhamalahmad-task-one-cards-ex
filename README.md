# Card Carousel

This is a simple card carousel built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The carousel displays a collection of cards, and it automatically switches the "active" class among the cards at regular intervals. When a card is clicked, it becomes the active card, and the previously active card loses the "active" class.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Development

The carousel is created using simple HTML for the card structure and CSS for basic styling, including the active card appearance.

In JavaScript, we handle the following functionalities:

- When a card is clicked, the "active" class is added to the clicked card and removed from the previously active card.

- We use the `setInterval` function to move the "active" class to the next card every 3 seconds.
